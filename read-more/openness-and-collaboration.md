# Openness and Collaboration - Engineering Principle

[Back to Engineering Principles](../engineering%20principles.md)

## Healthy Work Enviroment
When things go wrong we spend time on achieving tangible, beneficial outcomes, rather than placing blame.
- We can try new things without fear
- Psychological saftey
- Easier to identify and eliminate holes in knowledge
- We get stronger over time as weaknesses are found and addressed
### Practices
- We have a No Blame culture
- We encourage being curious and kind
### Anti-patterns
- Blame shifting

## Knowledge Sharing
Do not be afraid to show what you don't know, and volunteer the knowlege you have.
- An increased pool/source for solutions
- Shared knowledge and increased growth at individual level
### Practices
- We do pair programming
- We share our failures
- We offer our wisdom and seek it in others
- We maximise learning - from failure, from success, from others
### Anti-patterns
- Knowledge siloing

## Working Collaboratively
Engineering is a collaborative activity, so share be open and help others where you can.
- Prevents incorrect assumptions being drawn
### Practices
- We build consensus around decisions with wide impact
- We error on the side of overcommunication
### Anti-patterns
- Hero culture
