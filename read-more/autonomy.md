[Back to Engineering Principles](../engineering%20principles.md)

## Ownership
ownership is good
- Sense of ownership
- Duty of care
### Practices
- You own what you build (at individual and squad level)
### Anti-patterns
- QA
- Throwing things over the wall
- Micromanagement

## Freedom to evolve
freedom is good
- Empowered engineers
- Evolving, modern tech stack
- Get to use the right tools for the job
### Practices
- Try new things and cross boundaries
- Challenge yourself
### Anti-patterns
- Limited/locked into doing the same thing
- Still using angular 1.x

## Speed
speed is good
- Not being blocked
- Quick turn-around on value to market
### Practices
- Learn by doing (building MVPs, refine over time, don't over-engineer)
- Don't wait for someone else to solve things
### Anti-patterns
- Refactoring/refining/polishing to death something not yet in production
