[Back to Engineering Principles](../engineering%20principles.md)

Set yourself up to be able to deliver the most value for the customer with the least amount of friction. It’s about releasing often and without fear, knowing you can always fix any issue or roll back.

#### Practices

- Enable speed through process
- Good test coverage
- Quality is a long term enabler

- There’s nothing simple about simplicity
- Prioritise the problems that nobody has solved
- Be aware of services and libraries that can do the heavy lifting
- Focus on code that enhances the customer experience
- Use metrics or AB testing to confirm your hypothesis

#### Benefits

- Knowing it’s ok to release on Fridays
- Focussing on interesting problems not boilerplate

- You can determine the success of a feature

#### Anti-patterns

- Cutting corners to get stuff done
- Imagining what the customer wants without testing your hypothesis
