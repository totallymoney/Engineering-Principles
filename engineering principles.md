- Focus on code that enhances the customer experience
- Use metrics or AB testing to confirm your hypothesis

#### Benefits

- Focussing on interesting problems not boilerplate
- Providing value to the customer

#### Anti-patterns

- Cutting corners to get stuff done
- Imagining what the customer wants without testing your hypothesis

### We Own It

Ownership is the product of Autonomy, because if you have the freedom to choose you also are more likely to believe in your choices. It recognises the fact that we are a tech company, and we own the product. We own the problem space and should know what problem we are trying to solve for the customer extremely well.

- #no-estimates
- Be a part of the product

#### Benefits:

- We go at our own pace
- No need to cut corners to make deadlines which please our clients
- We have control over the quality of the product
- You unlikely to get blocked for hierarchical reasons
- If you want to you can lead

#### Antipatterns:

### Openness & collaboration

Create an environment where time is spent on achieving tangible, beneficial outcomes. Be solution oriented. Do not be afraid to show what you don't know. Maximise learning - from failure, from success, from others.

#### Practices
- No blame culture
- Share your failures
- Be curious and kind
- Offer your wisdom and seek it in others

#### Benefits
- We get stronger over time as weaknesses are found and addressed
- We can move fast, and try new things - without fear
- An increased pool/source for solutions to problems
- Psychological saftey
- Easier to identify and eliminate holes in knowledge
- Shared knowledge and increased growth at individual level

#### Anti-patterns
- Blame shifting
- Knowledge siloing
- Hero culture


#### No blame culture

things go wrong. production, inevitably, breaks. when there is a problem, the questions we ask are not to place blame. it helps to know who did what, so we know who to go to for more information; all so that we can better understand how to fix what’s broken. once the fires are out (if any), focus shifts to preventing the same thing from happening again in future.
by breaking something, all you’re doing is exposing a weakness in our process. by putting your hand up and communicating *the thing what you done borked*, you’re allowing us to move fast and well informed, to fix it, and minimise the learning cost. this practice, allows us to move fast, experiment, try things that are new or scary .. with due caution, but without fear of what happens when something goes wrong.

#### Share your failures

failure is a valuable learning resource. sharing failures can multiply the learning effect across a wider team; in some cases solutions, or easy fixes .. to turn a failure into a success, can come form unexpected places.

we expect things to fail (want to innovate and be ambitious .. if we’re not failing, we’re being too safe)

#### Be curious and kind

what we’re after, is psychological safety. we want an environment where no individual is afraid to show what they don’t know. take care in choosing the words, and tone of voice you use. if we’re asking questions, it’s to gain understanding.

(PRs don’t be savage, in retros etc. curious rather than judgemental)

#### Offer your wisdom and seek it in others

you don’t know what others don’t know. anyone can learn from anyone else. ask about how things are done, ask a about someones specialty, and share your own knowledge freely.

knowledge sharing is in our culture.
